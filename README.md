This a text-based two-player chess game played in the same terminal.
It was written by Steven Reed (myself) and Landon Truong as part of a larger class project.

To run:


Open files in VScode.


Go to ChessMain.cpp file.

Open the Running and Debugging Tab on the left side of the screen.

Click the green arrow to build and debug the file. 

Open the debug console.

Play the game according to the rules of chess and the instructions of the terminal.

Type quit for both the the piece you want to move and the location for where to move the piece to end the game at any time.
